<p>No stranger to storms, Florida doesn’t always live up to its Sunshine State moniker. This week, the region faced one of its biggest natural disasters in decades: Hurricane Ian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before hitting Florida, the Category 3 hurricane caused wide-scale destruction in Cuba. As the storm headed towards the U.S., it picked up pace and was upgraded to a Category 4 classification within days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the second-highest level possible — whereby winds up to 156 mph or more cause ‘catastrophic damage’, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saffir-Simpson wind scale</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Category 4 hurricane the scale states that, ‘most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts warn significant and varying health concerns will also arise in the wake of a hurricane’s devastation.</p>

<h2><a>Infectious and vector-borne diseases</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a major storm when water and electricity aren’t available, health experts can be concerned about the rise of infectious diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But experts say it’s not likely that uncommon diseases will pop up in an area even after a hurricane.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There is a common misperception that waves of new infectious disease hit the population after the flood waters recede,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/brian-labus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Labus</a>, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Public Health, explained to Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The reality is a lot less interesting,” he continued, “as people get infected with the same diseases after a disaster that they did before.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, for example, cholera won’t be a concern if it wasn’t an issue in the area previously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>other diseases to be aware of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Flooding can result in an increase in mosquito populations by providing more standing water in which they can breed,” revealed Labus. “This could cause an increase in the diseases normally found in the area, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/west-nile-virus">West Nile virus</a>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those forced to seek refuge in emergency shelters can also find themselves at higher risk of infectious diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we bring a lot of people into a small area, things like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/cold">common colds</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diarrhea">diarrheal</a>&nbsp;illnesses can spread more easily,” Labus said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And let’s not forget COVID-19. “The Omicron virus can spread very easily among crowds,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jun Wu</a>, PhD, professor of environmental and occupational health in University of California, Irvine’s Department of Public Health, told Healthline.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If someone is displaced in a crowded shelter, try to wear a mask to protect yourself and others,” Wu recommended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep a distance if you can, and, when possible, wash your hands before eating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>Water contamination</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Hurricane Ian hit Florida, authorities&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mysuncoast.com/2022/09/29/suncoast-begin-dig-out-after-ian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implemented</a>&nbsp;a boil water advisory in some areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contamination may occur “from flooding of wastewater treatment facilities or sewage overflow, street run-offs and agricultural run-offs, and so on,” explained Wu — leading to a spread of pathogens, viruses, and bacteria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, shared Wu, contaminated water may contain toxic chemicals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The spills from industrial facilities, as well as potential leakages from gas tanks and agricultural run-offs, can lead to increased concentrations of chemicals, industrial solvents, metals such as lead and arsenic, and pesticides, all in the stormwater.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Avoid drinking or using tap water until your water provider gives the all-clear. Instead, use bottled water where possible. If you have to use tap water, “water filters will be very helpful for temporary use,” noted Wu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also vital to refrain from walking through flood waters. You can’t see what’s lurking under the surface, and “cuts or scrapes could become infected after being in contact with contaminated water,” Labus shared.</p>
